We are a group of **developers, designers and digital security experts** with the aim of creating a digital security course for the Public Administration that is intuitive, fun and accessible for everyone. The digital security course stems from an idea of the [Digital Transformation Team](https://teamdigitale.governo.it/en).

We are working on this **open source project** thanks to the collaboration of developers with experience in the public and private sectors, who help us understand how each of us has **the possibility and the duty to protect ourselves from cyber attacks** thanks to some precautions at work and in everyday life.
